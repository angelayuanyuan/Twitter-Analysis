# Twitter Analysis
This is a project of using shiny apps to demonstrate a twitter analysis.

In this readme file, I am going to walk you through what I did in the shiny app, but you could also feel free to explore it by yourself!

## 1. Intro

Our Topic: How do people on Twitter react to Kevin Spacey's sex assualting scandals?

If you are not familiar with the background story, here is a link to a brief news report.

## 2. Data Manipulation

### Get Twitter Data

- *Key Word: @KevinSpacey*

- *English tweets only*


### Text Cleaning

- *Remove symbols*

- *Remove punctuations*

- *Remove stopwords including our customized stopwords* 


## 3. Text Analysis

On the shiny app, you could actually take a look at what people were tweeting about by yourself.

Here, we explore ***what is the most used word in these tweets?***

Okay, I shall admit, ***House of Cards*** is a really popular show.

However, what's our president doing over here??

To find out, go ahead and search his name in the ***Search*** column in the shiny app!!
